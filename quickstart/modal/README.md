```
moondream> admin set-inference-url https://yourname--moondream-server-dev.modal.run/v1
```

from PIL import Image

# to use with the example code, make sure to add /v1 at the end
model = md.vl(endpoint="https://yourname--moondream-server-dev.modal.run/v1")
image = Image.open("/path/to/image")

# query
answer = model.query(image, "What's in this image?")["answer"]
print(answer)
