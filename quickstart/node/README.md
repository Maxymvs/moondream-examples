# Moondream QuickStart - Node

This is a starter project to show you how to call Moondream.

## Requirements

- **To run it locally**: Download and install the [Moondream Server](https://moondream.ai/moondream-server)
- **To run it in the cloud**: Create an API KEY for the [Moondream Cloud](https://moondream.ai/cloud)

## Before you run
