# Moondream Examples

This repository contains sample code and examples to help developers learn how to work with [Moondream](https://moondream.ai), the world's most efficient multi-function Vision Language Model (VLM).

### About Moondream

Moondream is a state-of-the-art Vision Language Model that combines multiple vision capabilities in a tiny, efficient, and blazingly fast form factor. It's designed to be:

- **Efficient**: Optimized for performance and resource usage
- **Versatile**: Supports multiple vision-language tasks
- **Fast**: Delivers quick inference times
- **Compact**: Small model size without compromising capabilities

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

The examples in this project work with Python, Node, and Bash. Most examples are configured to run against Moondream locally using [Moondream Station](https://moondream.ai/station) â€“ a free Mac/Ubuntu app, or run against the [Moondream Cloud](https://moondream.ai/cloud), which offers a free tier.

#### Examples

Browse the examples below. Each one is fully functional and ready to run or modify:

| Example        | Description                                                                                                                                         |

| **[Python](quickstart/python/README.md)** | A hello world example showing how to call the model.                                                                                                |
| **[Car Detection](quickstart/python/detect_cars.ipynb)** | Notebook demonstrating caption, query, detect, and point while processing car images. Bounding boxes are normalized and converted to pixels for overlays. |
| **[Node.js](quickstart/node/README.md)** | Demonstrates how to interact with Moondream in a Node environment. |
| **[Modal Labs](quickstart/modal/README.md)** | Examples showing how to host and use Moondream Station on the cloud using Modal Labs.|
